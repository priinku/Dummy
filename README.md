Build this application as a production-ready system with no placeholders or partial implementations. Implement full Japanese language support across the entire UI, where every visible label, button, message, notification, and helper text switches dynamically between English and Japanese using a language toggle, with translations managed centrally. Ensure all LLM responses are streamed to the UI immediately as they are generated (token or chunk streaming), not displayed only after completion. Implement a role-based notification system where admins only see messages sent by users to admins, and users only see messages sent by admins to them, including a red unread indicator; additionally, support targeted admin messages using the syntax @username to deliver notifications only to the specified user. Replace local Docker-based MySQL storage with Supabase PostgreSQL as the persistent database, and design and create all required production tables including but not limited to users, roles, files, file_categories, notifications, chat_history, analytics, feedback, and message_threads, with proper relations, indexes, timestamps, and soft-delete support. Implement a ChatGPT-style recommendation popup that dynamically suggests follow-up questions or prompts in real time by matching keywords from the user’s current input and recent chat context. Create a secure user creation and management page allowing admins to add users with name, department, role, email, and password, storing credentials securely using hashing and saving all metadata in the database. Categorize uploaded files into General Affairs, HR, Accounting, or Others, store this category in the files table, and implement automatic question classification so that when a user asks a question, the system determines the most relevant category and restricts document retrieval and RAG context to files from that category only. Ensure the entire system follows production best practices including RBAC, secure authentication, scalable database access, clean APIs, and maintainable architecture.
